This folder hosts my submission of the final project for the [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/) Data Science Immersive Bootcamp and [Saudi Digital Academy](https://sda.edu.sa/)

The objective of this final project is to create a Resume Scoring algorithm to identify the most suitable candidates. The algorithm will parse resumes one by one and will give a score for the similarity between it and the job description. 

## Problem Statement

When a company post a job offer, it receives hundreds resumes. so, manual CV screening needs a lot of effort and time.

for instance, among 250 resume, there are just 4 to 6 resume match job requirement and they are eligible to move to next phase which is interviews.

### **Research Questions**

I do analysis to discover which resumes has been met the skills required in the job description 
 
## Data Gathering

- Job description of Data Scientist role in Elm company in document format from [Data Scientist in Elm company](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-deep-learning-consultant-at-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85-1468946631/?refId=3c37fe28-5f30-42c9-b9da-02866f173575&originalSubdomain=sa)

- 15 randomly resumes were collected from Resume Genius website for various fileds [resume Genius website](https://resumegenius.com/)  
for example Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Business Analyst, BI analyst, IT manager, Web developer and Java developer....

## Scoring

Cosine similarity  is the  simplest way to build a vector from text by count the words.

It’s simply measures the angle between the two vectors and returns a real value between -1 and 1.


## Visualization

The output is a bar chart sorted descending to show the best candidates for the job description.

## Limitation 

- The algorithm just accepts document files, so need more enhancement to accept both pdf and docx format files.

- Need to clean data both job descraption and resumes content from inuseful words like the and linked words.
