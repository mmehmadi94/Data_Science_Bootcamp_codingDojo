    "Thus far in this track, we have examined building and fitting machine-learning (ML) models “locally.” True, the notebooks have been located in the cloud themselves, but the models with all of their predictive and classification power are stuck in those notebooks. To use these models, you would have to load data into your notebooks and get the results there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we want those models to be accessible from a number of locations. And while the management of production ML models has a lifecycle all its own, one part of that is making models accessible from the web. One way to do so is to develop them by using third-party cloud tools, such as [Microsoft Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net) (not to be confused with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Service, which provides end-to-end lifecycle management for ML models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can develop and deploy a function that can be accessed by other programs over the web—a web service—that runs within Azure ML Studio. Cloud-based ML-development tools like Azure ML Studio streamline the building, training, and deployment of machine-learning models by providing a drag-and-drop interface and making a wide array of ML algorithms and tools readily available. Crucially, such tools simplify the deployment and management of ML models in production (not a focus of this course, but a major consideration in the real world). Let's revisit our simple linear model from the last session, this time in Azure ML Studio.\n",

    "The outliers have dragged our regression line off of the cluster. One way to address this is to add an additional, weighted term to the [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) equation that we used to calculate our regression line. Tuning this weight parameter for this additional term will help our regression put less emphasis on the outlying points and greater emphasis on the well-clustered points. The specific technique we'll use for this is called [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization) (also referred to as L2 regularization, which is how you will see it in Azure machine learning).\n",
